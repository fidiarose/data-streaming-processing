The Platform Development of the Distributed Processing for IoT Data Streams using Spark Streaming
Stream processing is becoming essential of IoT stack to increase the values and benefits for the organization. Stream processing requires data processing with high throughput, low latency and fault tolerance. Along with the growth in streaming data, centralized architecture will cause large delays for providing service. To solve this problem, additional resources or machines in the cluster are needed to maintain processing performance. It needs a system for distributed data processing. This research proposes to develop a distributed IoT data stream processing platform using Spark Streaming. 

The platform built consist of 4 components, such as data processing, data integration, storage and interface. The selection of these components is based on the availability and support of data source and data sinks on Spark Streaming.
